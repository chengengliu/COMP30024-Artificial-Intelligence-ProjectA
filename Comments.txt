Moving stage:
	loop through every chess piece on the board, check the surrounding enviroment.
	nested loops give n^2 time and space complexity

Massacre stage:
	The basic idea of path finding algorithm is to use best first search to find shortest path
	since the problem is move white piece to terminate black piece, we take the white piece as
	the staring node of a searching tree, and the black piece on the board is the node that we 
	need to find. For each white piece, we will always find the nearest black piece and find the
	shortest path to it. Worst case would be O(n*log(n)) if two piece at the most distant place 
	on board. By some conditions we also make sure that the same black piece would not be 
	terminated twice
